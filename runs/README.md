# Runs

This folder contains the numerical experiments that are run. Each training is identified with a unique timestamp.

Each folder contains the following sub-folders:
- **env_000**: the learning is performed in this folder, the files generated by the solver are saved here.
- **env_test_\*\*\***: evaluation runs are saved in this format. The reference number is controlled by the variable **runner.rank** in the configuration file.
- **logs**: the agent configurations saved at regular intervals (checkpoints) are saved here. 

Three folders are provided with the repository:
- **100**: contains the results using the opposition control strategy.
- **101**: contains the uncontrolled baseline.
- **1672737751**: contains the trained agent used to obtain the results presented in the paper.
